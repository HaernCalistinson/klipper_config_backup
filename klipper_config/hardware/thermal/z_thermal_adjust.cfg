########################################

[z_thermal_adjust]
temp_coeff: 0.0144
#   The temperature coefficient of expansion, in mm/degC. For example, a
#   temp_coeff of 0.01 mm/degC will move the Z axis downwards by 0.01 mm for
#   every degree Celsius that the temperature sensor increases. Defaults to
#   0.0 mm/degC, which applies no adjustment.
smooth_time: 2.0
#   Smoothing window applied to the temperature sensor, in seconds. Can reduce
#   motor noise from excessive small corrections in response to sensor noise.
#   The default is 2.0 seconds.
#z_adjust_off_above:
#   Disables adjustments above this Z height [mm]. The last computed correction
#   will remain applied until the toolhead moves below the specified Z height
#   again. The default is 99999999.0 mm (always on).
#max_z_adjustment:
#   Maximum absolute adjustment that can be applied to the Z axis [mm]. The
#   default is 99999999.0 mm (unlimited).
sensor_type: temperature_combined
sensor_list: temperature_sensor _frame_front_right,temperature_sensor _frame_back_left
#   Must be provided. List of sensors to combine to new "virtual"
#   sensor.
#   E.g. 'temperature_sensor sensor1,extruder,heater_bed'
combination_method: mean
#   Must be provided. Combination method used for the sensor.
#   Available options are 'max', 'min', 'mean'.
maximum_deviation: 999
#   Must be provided. Maximum permissible deviation between the sensors
#   to combine (e.g. 5 degrees). To disable it, use a large value (e.g. 999.9)
min_temp:0
max_temp:100
#   Temperature sensor configuration.
#   See the "extruder" section for the definition of the above
#   parameters.
#gcode_id:
#   See the "heater_generic" section for the definition of this
#   parameter.
